  <h2>Desert of the day</h2>
  
  <h1>Saharan Sun Sweets</h1>
<p><em>Delight in Desert Decadence</em></p>
<p>Journey through the flavors of the desert with Saharan Sun Sweets – an opulent dessert that marries the natural sweetness of dates with the nuttiness of almonds, the warmth of cinnamon and cardamom, and the floral notes of rose water and saffron. This rich, layered pastry is as golden as the dunes at sunset and provides an experience as luxurious as the silks traded along ancient caravan routes.</p>
<p><strong>Working time:</strong> 30 minutes<br><strong>Baking time:</strong> 25 minutes<br><strong>Resting time:</strong> 15 minutes<br><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium<br><strong>Number of servings:</strong> 8<br><strong>Kcal per serving:</strong> ~350 (depending on serving size)</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>200 g Medjool dates, pitted and chopped</li>
<li>150 g Almond flour</li>
<li>2 tsp Cinnamon, ground</li>
<li>1 tsp Cardamom, ground</li>
<li>4 tbsp Honey</li>
<li>2 Oranges, zest and juice</li>
<li>100 g Pistachios, crushed</li>
<li>1 tbsp Rose water</li>
<li>A pinch of Saffron threads</li>
<li>100 g Unsalted butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 180°C (356°F).</li>
<li>In a mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, cinnamon, and cardamom.</li>
<li>In a separate bowl, mix the chopped dates, orange zest, and half of the orange juice, ensuring the dates are well coated.</li>
<li>Fold the date mixture into the dry ingredients until just combined.</li>
<li>In a small saucepan, warm the honey over low heat, add the rose water, saffron, and remaining orange juice. Stir gently until the saffron begins to release its color, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Brush a square baking dish with some of the melted butter. Press half of the cake mixture into the bottom.</li>
<li>Drizzle half of the saffron-honey syrup over the first layer and then sprinkle with half of the crushed pistachios.</li>
<li>Press the remaining cake mixture on top and brush with the remaining melted butter.</li>
<li>Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until golden and firm to the touch.</li>
<li>While still warm, pour the remaining saffron-honey syrup over the baked dessert and garnish with the rest of the pistachios.</li>
<li>Let it rest for at least 15 minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
<li>Slice into pieces and serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>For a vegan version, substitute the honey with agave syrup and use a plant-based butter alternative. Elevate this dessert with a scoop of cardamom-infused ice cream or a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream for those who want an extra indulgent experience.</p>
