  <h1>Savory Sunset Supper</h1>
<p><em>Evoke, Embrace, Enjoy, Enthrall</em></p>
<p>A tapestry of Mediterranean hues and flavors, the &quot;Savory Sunset Supper&quot; is a symphony in the art of fusion cooking. Nestled in the heart of this dish are succulent chicken breasts, bathed in the aromatic company of thyme and rosemary, while the tang of lemon and the richness of olives provide a sensory experience akin to a serene sunset. A perfect dish for those evenings when you crave both comfort and a touch of gourmet complexity.</p>
<p><strong>Preparation Time:</strong> 25 minutes<br><strong>Cooking Time:</strong> 35 minutes<br><strong>Total Time:</strong> 1 hour<br><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Intermediate<br><strong>Servings:</strong> 4<br><strong>Calories per serving:</strong> Approximately 550 kcal</p>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 chicken breasts (approx. 150g each)</li>
<li>3 sprigs of fresh thyme (roughly 5g)</li>
<li>2 sprigs of fresh rosemary (roughly 5g)</li>
<li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
<li>1 lemon, zest and juice</li>
<li>60ml olive oil</li>
<li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
<li>200g baby spinach</li>
<li>150g feta cheese, crumbled</li>
<li>100g Kalamata olives, pitted</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation Steps:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F).</li>
<li>In a bowl, combine the minced garlic, lemon zest, and juice, olive oil, thyme, and rosemary. Whisk together to create a marinade.</li>
<li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper and lay them in a baking dish.</li>
<li>Pour the prepared marinade over the chicken, ensuring each piece is well-coated. Allow it to marinate for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Once marinated, place the chicken in the preheated oven and roast for 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove the dish from the oven and add cherry tomatoes and Kalamata olives around the chicken.</li>
<li>Return the dish to the oven and continue to roast for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked and the tomatoes are soft.</li>
<li>While the chicken is in the oven, wilt the baby spinach in a pan over medium heat with a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
<li>Take the chicken out of the oven, let it rest for a few minutes. On each plate, place a bed of wilted spinach.</li>
<li>Top the spinach with a chicken breast, tomatoes, feta cheese, and olives from the baking dish.</li>
<li>Spoon over any remaining juices from the baking dish over each serving.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tips to Vary or Improve:</h2>
<p>Consider adding a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomato and olive mixture for an additional depth of flavor. If desired, incorporate capers for an extra burst of tanginess. For those preferring an even richer dish, substitute traditional feta with a creamier goat&#39;s cheese. This recipe is versatile; experiment with different herbs or a squeeze of orange in place of lemon for a twist.</p>
