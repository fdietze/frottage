<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basil leaves - 20g</li>
<li>Flat-leaf parsley - 20g</li>
<li>Thyme sprigs - 10g</li>
<li>Garlic cloves - 2</li>
<li>Ripe tomatoes - 4 medium-sized</li>
<li>Red bell pepper - 1 large</li>

<li>Extra virgin olive oil - 30ml</li>
<li>Lemon - 1/2 for juice</li>
<li>Sea salt - to taste</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Begin by thoroughly washing all the fresh produce. Dry the herbs and vegetables using a salad spinner or a clean kitchen towel.</li>
<li>Pluck the basil leaves and parsley leaves from their stems. For the thyme, run your fingers down the sprigs to remove the tiny leaves.</li>
<li>Finely chop the garlic cloves. For those who prefer a milder garlic flavor, consider using a garlic press or grating the cloves to distribute them more evenly throughout the salad.</li>
<li>Dice the ripe tomatoes, red bell pepper, and cucumber into bite-sized pieces, aiming for uniformity for a harmonious presentation.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped vegetables and sprinkle over the assorted fresh herbs.</li>
<li>Drizzle the extra virgin olive oil over the salad. Squeeze the lemon juice, ensuring no seeds fall into the bowl, and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Toss the salad gently to ensure all ingredients are well-coated and glistening with the dressing.</li>
<li>Allow the salad to sit for about 5 minutes, which grants the flavors time to meld delightfully.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Serving:</h2>
<p>Divide the salad among four plates, ensuring an even distribution of herbs and vegetables. Enjoy as a light, standalone lunch or as an exquisite accompaniment to a main dish.</p>
<h2>Nutrition Tip:</h2>
<p>The &quot;Harmony Herb Huddle&quot; salad is not only a feast for the senses but also a trove of antioxidants, vitamins, and beneficial oils, contributing to a balanced and health-conscious diet.</p>
<h2>Variation Tip:</h2>
<p>To elevate this dish, consider adding toasted pine nuts or crumbled feta cheese for a contrast in texture and a touch of creamy richness. For an additional protein boost, grilled chicken breast or flaked salmon can be effortlessly incorporated into the salad.</p>
